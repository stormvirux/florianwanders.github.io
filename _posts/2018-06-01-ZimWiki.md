[Zim](http://zim-wiki.org/ "Zim-Wiki") is a fantastic note taking program that allows you to store all your thoughts/notes/ideas and to link between entries. Think of your personal Wikipedia, but much more accessible. My own wiki is structured as follows (I use numbers to have some entries always at the top):

	+ 1. todo
		Finland
		current paper
		coding projects
	+ 2. web design
		homepage
		wanderscoaching-com.stackstaging.com
		...
	+ 3. data science
		+ Bayesian statistics
		data viz
		...
	+ 4. phd
		1. submission
		2. funding
		conferences
		cool projects
		...
	+ bookmarks
	+ jobs
	+ private
		cooking
		...
	+ setup
	shortcuts
	
Zim allows me to have all my notes in one place, from my trip to Finland that I planned this summer, over the papers I am working on, to my favorite recipes. Even better, I can link between entries. E.g., when I write down ideas for a project in one entry, I can link to more detailed entries about components of that project in other entries. 
	

	
	
## Download Zim

You can download the free and open-source software zim [here](http://zim-wiki.org/downloads.html "Download Zim").
 



##  Tips & Tweaks


- As much as I love zim, I am not a friend of bright green headers. On Windows, navigate to (or create) the folder `C:/Users/usr/AppData/Roaming/zim/config/zim/profiles/Notes` and copy the file `style.conf` from `C:/Program Files (x86)/Zim Desktop Wiki/data` into this folder. Then open the copied file (e.g., in [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html "Download notepad++")) and change
	
	```
	[Tag h1]
	foreground = #4e9a06
	```
	
	into  
	
	```
	[Tag h1]
	foreground = #333
	```
	
	Also modify the other header tags (h2 through h6) to your linking. Save `style.conf`, close and re-open zim and enjoy a calmer interface (or perhaps you changed the colors from bright green to neon red). See also my post on [superuser](https://superuser.com/a/1262056/534265 "superuser") for more info and links to Linux. 
	
- To be able to copy images from one entry to another (say you want to restructure parts of your wiki), make sure you store all images outside of your notebook. In my case, I added a folder `images` into the folder `ZimNotebooks`, which already contained the folder `Notebook` (where my notes are stored). 2 more tips: 

	- You can resize images in zim by right-clicking and then selecting `Edit Properties`. 
	
	- Give images descriptive names, e.g., `effect-sizes.png` for an image with an overview of effect sizes. 


- The last entry in my wiki is `shortcuts`. I copied some commands that I use frequently from [here](http://zim-wiki.org/manual/Help/Wiki_Syntax.html "Zim syntax") and from [here](http://zim-wiki.org/manual/Help/Key_Bindings.html "Zim shortcuts"). Especially in the beginning I found it helpful to have these commands handy (although you can also do completely without and still enjoy zim).  


- You might realize in shock that you deleted an entry (or even a folder with many entries!) and there seems to be no way to get your content back. Don't panic, zim works with simple text files. All you have to do is go to your Recycle Bin and restore the entries/folders you deleted and you are good again. 


## Extras & Plugins

- You can customize Zim's preferences under `Edit > Preferences`. Under the tab `Plugins` you will find a list of plugins that you might want to activate (by simply ticking the respective check box). 

- You can use [this plugin](https://github.com/grahamrow/zim-mendeley-plugin/blob/master/README.md "Mendeley Plugin for Zim") to use Mendeley in Zim. See [here](http://superuser.com/a/1025259/534265 "superuser") for more details. 

- You can use git as a version control tool for your wiki.  See [here](http://zim-wiki.org/manual/Plugins/Version_Control.html "Version Control for Zim") for more details.
